## Team assessment and planning
It is good that most of our team members are good with python, which allows us to write the test file easily, since pyhton is the main languange for the test file for bitcoin. 

## Milestones
1. Become familiar with the code base - I think it would be a huge step for us to understand how does the bitcoin work. Because it is such a large project involving millions transaction around the world. Therefore, the mechanism behind it should be a complicated and well-developed system. We have to spend a lot of time to understand the system before we can actually tackle down some hard problems. 

2. Writing python tests - After being familiar with the code base, we need to come up with the test file to test our ideas. Once we can get a good test file, we can actually see if our progress is actually working or not. 

3. Contribute to github discussions - Some easy contribution for us to make in the early stage is the contribution to the github discussion, since we don't have to dig in too deep to solve the problems. 

4. Solve an issue and offer a pull request - Solving the actual issue and offer a pull request is the final step and the ultimate goal for us to do in this project.
