## Selection
I selected a wiki page about a Chinese rapper, [Gai](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=GAI_(musician)&oldid=825220239). One reason for this is that rap became popular recently (less than 1 year), while I have listened to Chinese rap for at least 10 years. Therefore, I am some what expert in this field. Another reason is that many of Chinese rappers' wiki page were created by fans not by record labels(record labels for rap are small or not formal in China). It would have a lot of room to improve both in content and in language. 
## Contribution
I have corrected some typo, grammar mistakes, and edited some content.
