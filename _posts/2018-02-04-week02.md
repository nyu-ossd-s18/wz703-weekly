## Difference
#### The Cathedral Model
The cathedral model of building software is that only a few selected people will be in the development process. No people from outside the exclusive group have access to the software before the whoel project is done. More importantly, the exclusive group would have a blueprint and knowing where exactly they are heading to. 
#### The Bazaar Model
The bazaar model of building software is that the whole project is available to everyone while anybody can make some positive impact on the project as well during the development process. Usually, the details and measures of the whole project is not very clear, while some big directions are determined. 

I would more likely to work under the bazaar model, becuase I can get a lot of new ideas and opinions. I will hardly lose my creativity and miss new information. On the other hand, I need to have a direction in mind where I want to be.
